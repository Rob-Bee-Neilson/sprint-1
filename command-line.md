Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
The computer thinks and talks in Binary, it's language. Binary is a very hard language for people to understand and communicate with, communication with computers in binary would be a very painful and slow process. People have made clever ways to translate between binary and human language + ways of thinking/operating to make it easier to use computers, this usually involves creating automated layers of translation/interaction between languages, generally the more complex and deep these layers are the easier it is for you to use your computer. However, the more complex and deep these layers are the more there is going on behind the scenes and the more there is that could go wrong. Using the command line is a more direct way of talking to your computer, operating on a simplier 'base' level. The computer user has to communicate in a more 'computer minded' mannor but it makes things more direct and stream lined, efficient. In a way it is kind of like learning pidgin English, a lingua franca, a simple language system as an inbetween two more complex languages.
